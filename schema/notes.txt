Goal: define a microdata format for Buyer's Guides

I plan to mostly work in JSON/CouchDB. The WHATWG spec for storing microdata
in JSON is here:

    http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/microdata.html#json

and can be produced by microdata.js, available here:

    https://gitorious.org/microdatajs/

and has a good demo here:

    http://foolip.org/microdatajs/live/

Here's a slightly abridged example from schema.org/Organization:

    {
      "type": [
        "http://schema.org/Organization"
      ],
      "properties": {
        "name": [
          "Google.org (GOOG)"
        ],
        "address": [
          {
            "type": [
              "http://schema.org/PostalAddress"
            ],
            "properties": {
              "streetAddress": [
                "38 avenue de l'Opera"
              ],
              "postalCode": [
                "F-75002"
              ],
              "addressLocality": [
                "Paris, France"
              ]
            }
          }
        ],
        "telephone": [
          "( 33 1) 42 68 53 00 "
        ],
        "faxNumber": [
          "( 33 1) 42 68 53 01 "
        ],
        "email": [
          "secretariat(at)google.org"
        ]
      }
    }

(I've omitted the enclosing {'items': [ ... ]} in the spec; that's for parsing
microdata out of a document, not for representing individual things.)

So, this is fairly verbose, but we'll use compression, and for the sake of
programming, it's better to be consistent than compact. I'll just use type
names, not URLs (or if you like, assume all my URLs are based at
http://spendright.org/schema/).

My goal is to use the schema.org microdata definitions as closely as possible,
and when I add fields, to try to be consistent as possible.

The WHATWG spec also talks about an "id" field (in addition to "type" and
"properties") which I'll use to reference other documents. At the top level
this will be "_id", of course.

I'll also add an "extra" field to store data that's potentially useful but that
we don't have a spec for yet.

Fields I'll need to add:

to Organization:
- subsidiaryOf

to Brand:
- ownedBy

to Organization and Brand:
- gtinPrefix -- prefix(es) for barcodes belonging to this brand/company

to Organization, Brand, Product:
- purchaseUrl -- where to buy this product

to Brand and Product
- naics and isicV4 (industry codes)

to Thing:
- category -- free-text category hierarchy. use slashes! Need this to find
  Good alternatives for products judged Bad or Mixed

(category exists in GoodRelations; it's just not in schema.org. See
http://www.heppnetz.de/ontologies/goodrelations/v1#category)

to NGO:
- donationUrl -- how to donate to this NGO (e.g. HRC)

Classes I'll want to add:

LaborUnion (subclass of Organization)
LaborUnionLocal (LaborUnion + localNumber -- labor411.org uses this)

Classes specific to Buyer's Guides:

CreativeWork/ConsumerCampaign
- judgment -- list of recommendations
- spatial -- Place -- spatial applicability (i.e. market)

Thing/Judgment
- target: Thing (usually Organization, Brand, Product)
- judgmentType: Enumeration/JudgmentType (Good, Bad, or Mixed)
- name (from Thing): short description (e.g. "50 out of 100")
- caveat: short phrase to include with an asterisk
- description: long-form descripton
- spatial (Place) -- spatial applicability (i.e. market)

I'll also eventually want to allow ad-hoc schema for tabular data accompanying
buyer's guides. I think I want to use Class and Property.

Here's an example from schema.org (it uses "Type", the old name, instead
of "Class").
