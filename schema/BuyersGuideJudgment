      <a href="BuyersGuideJudgment">BuyersGuideJudgment</a>

  </h1>
  <p>A moral judgment about one or more campaign targets.</p>

  <p>BuyersGuideJudgments in turn contain reviews, each of a single companies, brand, product, local business, etc. This follows the structure of many real buyer's guides on the web. For example, on the <a href="http://www.hotelworkersrising.org/HotelGuide/results.php">Hotel Workers Rising Union Hotel Guide</a>, each section ("Please Patronize", "Risk of Dispute", "ON STRIKE", etc.) would correspond to a separate BuyersGuideJudgment. BuyersGuideJudgments should not be used to group items by things other than moral judgment (e.g. business category).

<p>It is okay for a BuyersGuideJudgment to contain a single review, but you may also simply use <a href="Review">Review</a> directly; we've extended it with the additional fields <code>isPartOf</code> and <code>judgmentType</code>.

  <p>Each BuyersGuideJudgment has a <code>judgmentType</code> (<a href="Good">Good</a>, <a href="Bad">Bad</a>, <a href="MixedBag">MixedBag</a>, etc.). When aggregating information from several buying guide's, it's recommended to focus on these judgment types rather than numerical ratings from the <a href="Review">Review</a>s contained within the JudgmentType, for two reasons:

  <ul>
    <li>We want to keep the focus on storytelling and right and wrong. Quantitative judgments risk making everything an uninspiring gray area.</li>
    <li>The polarized nature of some campaigns gives a strong incentive to skew numeric ratings, which would make them incomparable anyway.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>If a buyer's guide is spread amongst multiple pages, the <code>isPartOf</code> field can be used to point back to buyer's guide's main page.<p>


 <p><em>Fields relevant to buyer's guides are <span class="relevant">highlighted</span>. Other fields are technically valid but may not ever be used.</em></p>
