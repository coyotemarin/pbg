Master Buying Guides List


GOALS IN CHOOSING GUIDES:

- Focus on guides relevant to:
  - consumers (not investors, workers, businesses, volunteers, etc.)
  - who are in the U.S. (San Francisco especially)
  - who are politically progressive (however you define that)
  Basically, this needs to work for someone before it can work for everyone,
  and I need to be able to dogfood it and test it on my friends. Feel free
  to add other campaigns/guides to the OUT OF SCOPE section below.
- Choose guides on sites that allow or do not explicitly ban scraping
  (look at /robots.txt and the Terms of Use, if any)
- Try to expose corner cases early:
  - Include a variety of targets (companies, brands, products, foods)
  - Aim for some overlap between guides, especially conflicting recommendations
- Avoid guides that have not been updated for more than a year.
- Prefer campaigns that have a decent-sized following (usually this means
  they're backed by some sort of non-profit). Nothing against change.org
  petitions, but they need to be successful and accurate. A consumer campaign
  with no supporters is not really a campaign.
- Simple guides targeting a single company or product are A-OK.
- Avoid "astroturf"; that is guides published by non-profits that are really
  a front for industry.


GOALS IN WRITING SCRAPERS:

- Accuracy above all else; scrapers should fail fast in the presence of
  unexpected changes rather than producing bad or incomplete data.
  (In Python, use pyassert).
- Include as much data as possible. Exceptions:
  - In large guides, try to avoid needing to download one page per product.
  - Don't scrape the long-form description of the campaign; try to grab
    a one-or-two paragraph summary and link to the rest.
  - Output (unicode) text, not HTML.
- Include donation URLs, links to other ways to take action, and anything else
  that will benefit the guide's publisher or their cause.
- Scripts that run on Python 2.6-3.x are preferred, other languages OK.
- Try to make scripts that just process data, and leave network access to
  other processes (e.g. curl).
  - See the top of python/mbg/hrc/data.py for an example two-step process
  that processes multiple pages on one site. If you are recursively scraping
  a website to an unknown depth, you are probably off track.
- Write unit tests for common code, but don't worry about writing tests for
  individual scrapers. They will be continuously integration-tested anyway.


COMPLETE:

Nothing can be here yet, as there is not yet a defined data format or
a standard for completeness.

TO WRITE SCRAPERS FOR:

(In rough order of priority. Disclaimer: just because something is on this
list does not mean I fully or even partially support it.)

boycottkochbrothers.com - Boycott Koch Industries
- http://www.boycottkochbrothers.com/
- Maybe not the shiniest, or most coherent site (ironic that they ask you to
  fight the Koch brothers by supporting the ACLU, which the Koch Brothers also
  support; yay, everybody likes the ACLU!), but boycotting the Koch Brothers is
  pretty much the prime example of an idea that has wide support but is messy
  to keep track of in practice. And they seem to be keeping their list of
  brands up-to-date.
- also no robots.txt whatsoever
- Check out their awesome printable buying guide:

Hotel Workers Rising - Union Hotel Guide
- http://www.hotelworkersrising.org/HotelGuide/results.php
- Many variations of "boycott Hyatt, except unionized Hyatt hotels" exist
  on the web, but this lists all (presumably) hotel locations and is
  consistently organized. For an example of similar data in a much messier
  format, see http://www.unionlabel.org/?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&HomeID=150708&page=Boycott.

Stop Rush - Rush Limbaugh Sponsor List
- http://stoprush.net/rush_limbaugh_sponsor_list.php
- actual data is loaded through JavaScript; use Chrome Developer Tools
  or similar to get the actual data URL
- Note that the "Statement" column indicates the sponsor has stopped
  advertising (this is a bit non-obvious).

fishwise.org - Sustainable Fish Buying Guides:
- http://fishwise.org/
- Make sure to include Retailers, Suppliers, Producers, Restaurants
- no Terms of Use/policy against copying

Environmental Defense Fund - Seafood Selector
- http://seafood.edf.org/
- Non-commercial redistribution explicitly allowed; see
  http://www.edf.org/about/this-site/copyright

CODE PINK - Stolen Beauty Campaign
- http://www.stolenbeauty.org/
- Summary: boycott AHAVA. So, this doesn't really require a scraper
- But, they also call for action against retailers that sell AHAVA products.


CONSIDER WRITING SCRAPERS FOR:

(Sites whose terms and conditions explicitly prohibit re-publishing their data,
but who might conceivably share them if approached.)

Monterey Bay Aquarium Seafood Watch
- http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/cr/cr_seafoodwatch/sfw_recommendations.aspx
- Terms of Use: http://www.montereybayaquarium.org/sg/sg_copyright.aspx
  - (no copying under any circumstances)
- Primary goal of the guide is to protect ocean/fisheries.
- However, may be covered by fishwise.org/EDF, who have less restrictive terms

Environmental Working Group Consumer Guides:
- http://www.ewg.org/consumer-guides
- Reprint permission: http://www.ewg.org/reprintpermission
  - must ask first, non-commercial use only
- Guides generate some revenue through Amazon affiliate links, paper guide
  sales, but EWG probably is funded mostly through donations.
  - Accepts tax-deductible donations to maintain the guides here:
    https://donate.ewg.org/t/11908/p/d/environmental_working_group/ewgcontrib/public/index.sjs?donate_page_KEY=2036


DO NOT SCRAPE:

(Sites who prohibit access through robots.txt, require a login for access, or
who use their guides as a significant revenue stream.)

Consumer Reports:
- http://www.consumerreports.org/cro/index.htm
- Requires paid subscription and login
- Primary goal is to protect consumers.

ethical consumer:
- http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/
- robots.txt prohibits scraping
- requires free login
- sells guides
- essentially a competing buying guide aggregator


OUT OF SCOPE, MAYBE LATER?

(divestment campaigns, companies that only sell
business-to-business, products not in the U.S., campaigns offensive to most
progressives)

The Cost of Knowledge - Elsevier Boycott
- http://thecostofknowledge.com/
- Goal is to ask academics not to publish, referee, or edit articles in
Elsevier Journals
