COMPLETE ENOUGH TO BE USABLE:

Hotel Workers Rising - Union Hotel Guide
- http://www.hotelworkersrising.org/HotelGuide/results.php
- Python: mbg.unitehere.uhg
- Many variations of "boycott Hyatt, except unionized Hyatt hotels" exist
  on the web, but this lists all (presumably) hotel locations and is
  consistently organized. For an example of similar data in a much messier
  format, see http://www.unionlabel.org/?zone=/unionactive/view_article.cfm&HomeID=150708&page=Boycott.

TO WRITE PARSERS FOR:

(In roughly order of priority, but work on whatever interests you. Disclaimer:
just because something is on this list does not mean I fully or even partially
support it.)

boycottkochbrothers.com - Boycott Koch Industries
- http://www.boycottkochbrothers.com/
- Maybe not the shiniest, or most coherent site (ironic that they ask you to
  fight the Koch brothers by supporting the ACLU, which the Koch Brothers also
  support; yay, everybody likes the ACLU!), but boycotting the Koch Brothers is
  pretty much the prime example of an idea that has wide support but is messy
  to keep track of in practice. And they seem to be keeping their list of
  brands up-to-date.
- also no robots.txt whatsoever
- Check out their awesome printable buying guide:
  http://www.boycottkochbrothers.com/popup_kochprocducts.shtml

Stop Rush - Rush Limbaugh Sponsor List
- http://stoprush.net/rush_limbaugh_sponsor_list.php
- actual data is loaded through JavaScript; use Chrome Developer Tools
  or similar to get the actual data URL
- Note that the "Statement" column indicates the sponsor has stopped
  advertising (this is a bit non-obvious).

Labor 411 (Union Made guide):
- http://www.labor411.org/consumer-products
- http://www.labor411.org/city-directories/san-francisco
- http://www.labor411.org/city-directories/los-angeles
- need to load a lot of pages to do this right. For example, only
  "select stores" of CVS are union:
  (http://www.labor411.org/index.php?option=com_mtree&task=viewlink&link_id=8772&Itemid=215)
- Pretty fuzzy idea of what is a brand and what is a company:
  http://www.labor411.org/index.php?option=com_mtree&task=viewlink&link_id=8766&Itemid=215

fishwise.org - Sustainable Fish Buying Guides:
- http://fishwise.org/
- Make sure to include Retailers, Suppliers, Producers, Restaurants
- no Terms of Use/policy against copying

CODE PINK - Stolen Beauty Campaign
- http://www.stolenbeauty.org/
- Summary: boycott AHAVA. So, this doesn't really require a parser
- But, they also call for action against retailers that sell AHAVA products.

Environmental Defense Fund - Seafood Selector
- http://seafood.edf.org/
- Non-commercial redistribution explicitly allowed; see
  http://www.edf.org/about/this-site/copyright
- probably about the same data as fishwise.org

ROC United Diners Guide
- http://rocunited.org/dinersguide/
- Labor conditions for major restaurants and chains
- only available in PDF (and App form)
- Data is a bit fiddly; how to make a judgment? I guess 2+ stars is Good, 1 star is Mixed, and 0 stars or a sad face is Bad

behindthebrands.org (Oxfam):
- detailed ratings for major brands
- best result is orange (not good enough to be yellow), so would look like a boycott of all major brands, which is surely not the intent. Probably should rate them Mixed or Bad (red or dark red).


MIGHT BE STALE:

(Contact the author to find out if it's still up-to-date)

EthicalShopping.com (Consumer Ethics Inc.)
- pretty straightforward, wide variety of product categories
- http://www.ethicalshopping.com/support.html
- http://www.ethicalshopping.com/boycott.html
- site is (c) 2013, but last article is from 2008.
- emailed them, no response

Food Empowerment Project
- http://www.foodispower.org/chocolatelist.php
- Huge, but only includes VEGAN chocolates. Sigh.
- says (c) 2010; is this out of date?


CONSIDER WRITING PARSERS FOR:

but who might conceivably share them if approached.)

- http://www.ewg.org/consumer-guides
- Reprint permission: http://www.ewg.org/reprintpermission

who use their guides as a significant revenue stream.)

- Requires paid subscription and login
- Primary goal is to protect consumers.

ethical consumer:
- http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/

OUT OF SCOPE, MAYBE LATER?

(divestment campaigns, companies that only sell
business-to-business, products not in the U.S., campaigns offensive to most
progressives)

The Cost of Knowledge - Elsevier Boycott
- http://thecostofknowledge.com/
- Goal is to ask academics not to publish, referee, or edit articles in
Elsevier Journals
